# Addepar Typing Game

Some code that may or may not power Addepar's financial platform.

https://addepar.com/ leads with an intro video. There's a lot of nonsense going on, but Dan and I noticed this screenshot in particular:

Where did the agency get this code from?

We looked for one of the snippets in the code and were able to track it down. This snippet is online at exactly one place according to google: http://www.javascriptsource.com/games/typing-test-applicationgame-by-sanket-sinha-150129024506.html. It's a mystery how the video agency found this code; our best guess is they searched for "javascript source snippet" or something and grabbed one of the random examples on this website.

For your enjoyment, this brilliant game is now re-hosted at http://alexzirbel.com/addepar-typing-game/ so you can play it yourself.
