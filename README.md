# Addepar Typing Game

The code that (maybe) powers Addepar's financial platform.

https://addepar.com/ has an intro video, where there's a lot of nonsense going on, but in particular this screenshot:

Where did the agency get this code from?

We looked for one of the snippets in the code and were able to track it down. The code is online at exactly one place according to google: http://www.javascriptsource.com/games/typing-test-applicationgame-by-sanket-sinha-150129024506.html. It's a mystery how the video agency found this code; our best guess is they searched for "javascript source snippet" or something and grabbed one of the random examples on this website.

For your pleasure, the full snippet is now re-hosted at http://alexzirbel.com/addepar-typing-game/ so you can play this brilliant game for yourself.
